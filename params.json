{"name":"Image2ascii","tagline":"An image to ascii converter","body":"### An Olin College Software Design Project\r\nBy Mitchell Kwock, Madison May, Jacob Kingery, and Bill Warner\r\n\r\n\r\nChecking the code is as simple as: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/madisonmay13/Image2ASCII.git \r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git fork https://github.com/madisonmay13/Image2ASCII.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What we set out to do\r\n\r\nImage2Ascii is a project designed to push the limits of algorithmic ASCII art generation.  Image2Ascii will eventually support both a real time ASCII conversion engine using greyscale comparison and a slower but more detailed character conversion method.  \r\n\r\n### Check out a sample\r\nIf you'd like to take a look at the result, its as easy as git cloning the repo or downloading the tarball, then executing the following in the root directory of the project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python terminal_movie.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll have to install a few dependencies if you don't have them already installed.  Currently, this project requires gimp, ffmpeg, mencoder, scikit, and cv.  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nBill Warner - @altodyte\r\n\r\nJacob Kingery - @jacobkingery \r\n\r\nMadison May - @madisonmay13\r\n\r\nMitchell Kwock - @mtkwock\r\n\r\n### Want to help out?\r\nFeel free to pull and contribute!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
