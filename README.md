Image2ASCII
===========

An image to ascii converter

In it's current state, Image2Ascii is a conglomeration of python scripts, C++ code, compiled programs, and bash commands.  
We hope to clean up this repository and publish a more polished version in the near future.

Update: final version is available at https://github.com/madisonmay/Asciify_Final
